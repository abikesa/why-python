# Usage

To quickly run Python code that I provide, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**: It's a good practice to create a virtual environment for your projects to manage dependencies.

    ```bash
    python -m venv myenv
    ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:

    - On Windows:
      ```bash
      myenv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
      ```bash
      source myenv/bin/activate
      ```

4. **Install Necessary Packages**: Use `pip` to install any packages required for the code. I will usually list them if they are needed.

    ```bash
    pip install package_name
    ```

5. **Run the Python Script**: Save the code I provide into a `.py` file (e.g., `script.py`) and run it using the Python interpreter.

    ```bash
    python script.py
    ```

Alternatively, you can use Jupyter Notebook or VSCode for an interactive environment:

### Using Jupyter Notebook

1. **Install Jupyter**:
    ```bash
    pip install jupyterlab
    ```

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

3. **Create a New Notebook**: In your browser, create a new notebook and copy-paste the code into a cell. Run the cell to execute the code.

### Using VSCode

1. **Install VSCode**: Download and install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. **Install Python Extension**: Open VSCode and install the Python extension from the Extensions marketplace.

3. **Open a New File**: Create a new Python file (e.g., `script.py`), paste the code, and save the file.

4. **Run the Code**: You can run the code directly in VSCode by right-clicking the file and selecting "Run Python File in Terminal."

These methods should provide you with quick and efficient ways to run Python code on your machine.
